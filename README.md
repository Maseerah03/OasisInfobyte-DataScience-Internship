# Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship

This repository contains all the projects I completed as part of my Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte (October 2023 batch). The internship provided hands-on experience with real-world datasets and practical applications of machine learning, data analysis, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.

Each project is organized into its own folder, with code, supporting files, and a brief explanation of the approach used.

## Projects Completed

### 1. Iris Flower Classification
A machine learning project to classify iris flowers into different species using petal and sepal measurements. This project involved data preprocessing, training classification models, and evaluating model performance.

### 2. Unemployment Analysis with Python
An exploratory data analysis project focused on unemployment trends in India. The work involved data cleaning, visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and drawing insights from public datasets.

### 3. Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Built a regression model to predict used car prices based on features like year, mileage, and brand. The project covered data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using metrics like RÂ² and MAE.

### 4. Email Spam Detection using NLP
Applied natural language processing techniques and machine learning to build a spam filter that classifies emails as spam or not spam. The project involved text cleaning, vectorization, model building, and accuracy analysis.

### 5. Sales Prediction using Python
Developed a time series forecasting model to predict future sales for a retail dataset. This included identifying trends and patterns, applying forecasting techniques, and visualizing predictions to support business decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- NLP (CountVectorizer, TF-IDF)
- Regression and classification algorithms
- Time series analysis

## About the Internship

This internship was offered by [Oasis Infobyte](https://oasisinfobyte.com), aimed at helping aspiring data scientists apply theoretical knowledge to practical projects. It strengthened my understanding of end-to-end data science workflows and gave me valuable exposure to real-world problem-solving with data.
