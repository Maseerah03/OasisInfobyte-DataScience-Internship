# Unemployment Analysis with Python

## Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes unemployment data across various regions in India using interactive visualizations. The goal was to identify regional trends in unemployment rates and present the data in a visually meaningful way using Plotly and Matplotlib.

## Dataset

The dataset used is a CSV file titled `Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv`, which includes estimated unemployment rates, region/state names, and time stamps. It provides unemployment data for different regions across India up to November 2020.

## Key Tasks Performed

- Loaded and inspected the dataset using Pandas
- Identified key columns such as "Region", "Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)", and timestamps
- Performed exploratory data analysis using:
  - Bar charts (state-wise and region-wise comparisons)
  - Box plots (distribution of unemployment rates)
  - Scatter plots (for trend visualization)
  - Histograms (to observe frequency distributions)

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly Express

## Results and Observations

- Created multiple region-wise unemployment rate comparisons using different chart types
- Found variation in unemployment rates across different states and regions
- Interactive visualizations made it easier to compare data and observe patterns

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used for exploratory data analysis on socio-economic issues. With the help of visual tools like Plotly, meaningful insights can be drawn from complex datasets, which can support decision-making and policy analysis.
