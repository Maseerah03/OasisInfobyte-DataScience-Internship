# Sales Prediction using Python (Linear Regression)

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict product sales based on advertising budgets using simple linear regression. The model helps estimate how much sales will be generated by investing in different advertising channels such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

## Dataset

The dataset `Advertising.csv` includes:
- Advertising spend across three media channels: TV, Radio, Newspaper
- Corresponding product sales figures

The target variable is `Sales`, and the features are `TV`, `Radio`, and `Newspaper`.

## Key Tasks Performed

- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Visualized relationships using:
  - Pair plots
  - Histograms
  - Heatmaps (correlation matrix)
- Selected TV advertising spend as the main predictor for simple linear regression
- Split the data into training and test sets
- Trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn
- Predicted sales on test data
- Visualized predictions vs actual results

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression)

## Results

- The model was able to capture the linear relationship between TV ad spend and sales.
- Coefficients and intercept were extracted to form the prediction equation.
- Visual inspection showed a reasonable fit of predicted values to actual sales data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how simple linear regression can be used to forecast sales based on a single independent variable. It highlights the importance of data visualization in identifying strong predictors and understanding relationships between variables.
